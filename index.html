                    Mid-Autumn Festival, Zhongqiu Jie (中秋节) in Chinese, is also called the Mooncake Festival or the Moon
                    Festival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the second most important festival in China after Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn is an official
                    public
                    holiday. In 2023, the festival falls on September 29th, which is close to China’s National Day on
                    October 1st. Therefore, people living in Mainland China will enjoy an 8-day public holiday (from
                    September 29th to October 6th).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In China, Mid-Autumn Festival is a reunion time for families, a little like Thanksgiving. Chinese
                    people
                    celebrate it by gathering for dinners, worshiping the moon, lighting paper lanterns, eating moon
                    cakes,
                    etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also celebrated by many other countries, such as America (mainly in the Asian American
                    community),
                    Singapore, and Malaysia. The date is the same as in China, but there is no public holiday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also known in many Asian countries as the Moon Festival or Lantern Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival
                    welcomes the autumn harvest and full moon. Asia Mid-Autumn Festival features Taiwanese artists and
                    photography, storytelling, and exciting art activities such as lantern-making, paper cutting, and
                    faux mooncakes.

            <h1>Origins of Tết Trung Thu</h1>
            <div class="origins-item">
                <p>
                    While the Mid-autumn Festival originated in China and is celebrated in many Asian countries, the
                    Vietnamese version has its own traditions and legends. Our best-known tale is about a man named Cuội
                    who
                    hung on to a magical banyan tree as it floated up to the moon. We say that if you look closely at
                    the
                    full moon, you can see the shadow of a man sitting under a tree. Children parade lanterns in the
                    streets
                    the night of Mid-autumn Festival to help light the way to earth for Cuội from the moon.

                    In the weeks before Tết Trung Thu, you will see and hear groups of lion dancers practicing on the
                    streets.
                    Mooncake stalls appear on every other corner, pop-ups with elaborately decorated boxes filled with a
                    variety
                    of mystery cakes and fillings. City districts team up with preparations of toys, lanterns and
                    colourful
                    masks in anticipation. The most popular Trung Thu lantern is a star made with red cellophane. You’ll
                    see
                    these lanterns for sale on streets all over Vietnam in the days leading up to the festival.

            <h1>Mooncake madness</h1>
            <div class="origins-item">
                <p>
                    All across Vietnam, families welcome Tết Trung Thu by placing a five-fruit tray and cakes on our
                    ancestral
                    altar. We offer the food to our ancestors and worship, before feasting on mooncakes -- usually
                    outside
                    under
                    the light of the moon. Round or square, these cakes are moulded with elaborate details of flowers,
                    carp
                    and
                    geometric patterns.

                    The two most common types are bánh dẻo (soft, sticky cakes with a mochi-texture) and bánh nướng
                    (baked
                    cakes
                    with a thick wheat crust). Mooncakes in Vietnam come in a seemingly infinite variety of flavours,
                    both
                    sweet
                    and savoury. Feel free to buy a box of mooncakes to enjoy yourself, or to share with your Vietnamese
                    friends
                    and hosts.

                    On the night of the full moon, children bearing brightly coloured lanterns form raucous processions
                    and
                    tour
                    their neighbourhoods singing songs. You will see a male dancer wearing a round happy-faced mask that
                    symbolises the moon. He urges the lion dancers on and delights the crowd with his comical moves.
                    This is
                    the
                    Earth God, Ông Địa, who represents the fullness of the earth and reminds onlookers to give thanks
                    for
                    its
                    bounty. Ông Địa always brings joy and puts a smile on every Vietnamese child's face.

                    Lion dancing or múa lân is an essential element of the Mid-autumn festivities. Groups of children
                    gather,
                    each carrying a red lantern. Everyone sings along to the cheerful Mid-autumn Festival songs
                    memorized
                    since
                    childhood. Excitement peaks when drumbeats ring out from down the dark street. The smaller kids
                    shrink
                    back
                    and the older ones run forward as a mythical lion bursts into their courtyard, its giant head and
                    sinuous
                    body borne by a team of acrobatic dancers.
                    With its gaping mouth and protruding eyes, the lion is both comical and formidable. The dancers
                    lunge
                    closer
                    to the crowd, making the kids scream and laugh at their antics. Under the light of the full moon,
                    the
                    lion’s
                    red sequined body sparkles as it dances. For Vietnamese children, not much else beats this
                    spectacular
                    performance on the night of Trung Thu.
