                While the Mid-autumn Festival originated in China and is celebrated in many Asian countries, the
                Vietnamese version has its own traditions and legends. Our best-known tale is about a man named Cuội
                who
                hung on to a magical banyan tree as it floated up to the moon. We say that if you look closely at
                the
                full moon, you can see the shadow of a man sitting under a tree. Children parade lanterns in the
                streets
                the night of Mid-autumn Festival to help light the way to earth for Cuội from the moon.

        The celebration of the harvest is an important part of Tết Trung Thu, as many Vietnamese live in rural
        areas and work as farmers. Tết Trung Thu marks a joyous occasion when the work is finished and there’s
        time to spend with loved ones.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Preparations begin</h1>

    <p>
        In the weeks before Tết Trung Thu, you will see and hear groups of lion dancers practicing on the streets.
        Mooncake stalls appear on every other corner, pop-ups with elaborately decorated boxes filled with a variety
        of mystery cakes and fillings. City districts team up with preparations of toys, lanterns and colourful
        masks in anticipation. The most popular Trung Thu lantern is a star made with red cellophane. You’ll see
        these lanterns for sale on streets all over Vietnam in the days leading up to the festival.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Mooncake madness</h1>
    
    <p>
        All across Vietnam, families welcome Tết Trung Thu by placing a five-fruit tray and cakes on our ancestral
        altar. We offer the food to our ancestors and worship, before feasting on mooncakes -- usually outside under
        the light of the moon. Round or square, these cakes are moulded with elaborate details of flowers, carp and
        geometric patterns.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The two most common types are bánh dẻo (soft, sticky cakes with a mochi-texture) and bánh nướng (baked cakes
        with a thick wheat crust). Mooncakes in Vietnam come in a seemingly infinite variety of flavours, both sweet
        and savoury. Feel free to buy a box of mooncakes to enjoy yourself, or to share with your Vietnamese friends
        and hosts.

        On the night of the full moon, children bearing brightly coloured lanterns form raucous processions and tour
        their neighbourhoods singing songs. You will see a male dancer wearing a round happy-faced mask that
        symbolises the moon. He urges the lion dancers on and delights the crowd with his comical moves. This is the
        Earth God, Ông Địa, who represents the fullness of the earth and reminds onlookers to give thanks for its
        bounty. Ông Địa always brings joy and puts a smile on every Vietnamese child's face.

    <h1>Lion dancing</h1>

    <p>
        Lion dancing or múa lân is an essential element of the Mid-autumn festivities. Groups of children gather,
        each carrying a red lantern. Everyone sings along to the cheerful Mid-autumn Festival songs memorized since
        childhood. Excitement peaks when drumbeats ring out from down the dark street. The smaller kids shrink back
        and the older ones run forward as a mythical lion bursts into their courtyard, its giant head and sinuous
        body borne by a team of acrobatic dancers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        With its gaping mouth and protruding eyes, the lion is both comical and formidable. The dancers lunge closer
        to the crowd, making the kids scream and laugh at their antics. Under the light of the full moon, the lion’s
        red sequined body sparkles as it dances. For Vietnamese children, not much else beats this spectacular
        performance on the night of Trung Thu.

    <p class="place">Hanoi</p>
    
    <p>
        If you’re in Hanoi before the Mid-Autumn Festival, be sure to visit Hàng Mã and Lương Văn Can. These streets
        will be packed with a variety of toys and lanterns. Another Hanoi address to visit before the big night is
        87 Mã Mây, where you can watch local artisans preparing festival crafts. On the eve of Mid-autumn, the Youth
        Theatre on Ngô Thì Nhậm Street and the Children’s Palace on Lý Thái Tổ Street host children’s musical shows.
    </p>
    
    <p class="place">Hội An</p>
    
    <p>
        Hội An is famous for its full moon celebrations year-round. For the Mid-autumn Festival, this riverside town
        kicks the party up a notch. Locals and travellers pour into the Ancient Town on foot. Dancers and their
        drumming troupes prowl the streets, performing in front of pagodas and businesses. There's music and all
        sorts of revelry up and down the banks of the Thu Bồn River, and in the countryside, every home has an altar
        out front.

    <p class="place">Ho Chi Minh City</p>
    
    <p>
        The area of Chợ Lớn in Ho Chi Minh City is home to exciting Mid-autumn festivities. Stop by Lương Như Hộc
        Street, famous for its lanterns, masks and lion heads overflowing on the sidewalks. This is the perfect spot
        to pick up a souvenir lion head. The shop at 109 Triệu Quang Phục Street has been selling lion heads to the
        city’s best dancers for five decades.
